// Ported from eds_tui/main.py's agentic_loop()/final_answer()/tools_for()/
// load_skill()/create_skill(), line-by-line against the Python source — this
// is the highest-risk module in the whole port (turn-budget/escalation
// state machine), so nothing here was re-derived from prose.
//
// Two turn-budget subtleties that are easy to get wrong and MUST be
// preserved exactly (confirmed by re-reading main.py:817-936 directly):
//   1. HARD_MAX_TURNS/SMALL_MAX_TURNS are checked against `turns` (the
//      ACTIVE model's own counter), never `total` (the whole-run counter,
//      which only feeds `stats.turns` for observability and never gates
//      anything).
//   2. Escalating because the small model ran out of its own turn budget
//      DOES reset `turns` to 1 (the newly-active main model gets a full
//      fresh budget for the very same loop iteration). Escalating because
//      the small model's own chat() call THREW does NOT reset `turns` —
//      it keeps counting from wherever it already was. These are two
//      different code paths in the Python original with different reset
//      behavior; conflating them would be a real, subtle bug.
