// The `consult_specialist` tool: lets the main model (or a tier-3 specialist
// standing in for it) proactively hand off ONE hard sub-piece of the
// current task — not the whole session — to whichever configured pool
// entry best fits it, get a report back, and keep working the rest of the
// task itself. Deliberately distinct from tryEscalateToSpecialist in
// agent.ts (tier-3): that only fires mechanically, once per run, when the
// main model has already exhausted its whole turn budget or its request
// threw, and hands off control of the ENTIRE remaining session. This fires
// by the model's own choice, any number of times, and control always
// returns to the caller.
//
// Structurally mirrors subagent.ts's bounded sub-loop (shell-only tools, no
// view of the parent conversation, same salvage-on-exhaustion pattern via
// FINAL_ANSWER_NUDGE) — but the model running the loop is picked per call
// from the pool via pickSpecialistModel, not a fixed smallModel.
